Taking into account that the least common multiple of two positive integers A and B equals A·(B/GCD(A, B)), where GCD(A, B) is the greatest common divisor of A and B, and using the GCD2 function from the task Func46, write an integer function LCM2(A, B) that returns the least common multiple of A and B. Using this function, find the least common multiple for each of pairs (A, B), (A, C), (A, D) provided that integers A, B, C, D are given.
