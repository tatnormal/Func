Write a function Mean(X, Y) that computes the arithmetical mean (X+Y)/2 and the geometrical mean (X·Y)1/2 of two positive real numbers X and Y and returns the result as two real numbers (X and Y are input parameters). Using this function, find the arithmetical mean and the geometrical mean of pairs (A, B), (A, C), (A, D) provided that real numbers A, B, C, D are given.
