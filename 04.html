Write a real-valued function RingS(R1, R2) that returns the area of a ring bounded by a concentric circles of radiuses R1 and R2 (R1 and R2 are real numbers, R1 > R2). Using this function, find the areas of three rings with given outer and inner radiuses. Note that the area of a circle of radius R can be found by formula S = p·R2. Use 3.14 for a value of p.
